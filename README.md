# ally-challenge

##Hey potential employers!
I made this using jquery Sass and Html5. Currently, the grunt build imagemin task doesn't work locally,
so if you copy this repo down there may be a hangup if you try to build it. it is hosted at 
[http://joshuawordsmith.github.io/ally-challenge/](http://joshuawordsmith.github.io/ally-challenge/) if you want to see the
built version that works.

To run this locally after copying it down navigate into the directory, run 
```
npm install
```
and once that finishes, run
```
grunt serve
```
and check your
```
localhost:9000
``` 
in the browser. If you have any questions feel free to email me, and if you want to see more of my stuff
swing over to [http://joshuawordsmith.github.io/portfolio/](http://joshuawordsmith.github.io/portfolio/)
